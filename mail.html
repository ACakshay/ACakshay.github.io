<a href="mailto: info@pm.gov.ma?subject=Regarding preparations for the Mega event- FIFA World Cup, 2030 and dogs culling&body="Dear Mr. Prime Minister,

I convey my congratulations on the exciting opportunity to co-host the 2030 FIFA World Cup alongside Spain and Portugal. This is a wonderful chance for Morocco to showcase its rich cultural heritage and hospitality to the world. 

However, I express  my deep concern  upon learning about the Moroccan government's plan to cull up to three million stray dogs in preparation for the World Cup. This decision has sparked widespread condemnation from animal welfare organizations and activists worldwide.

As an animal lover, I strongly believe that this plan is inhumane, unnecessary, 
and contradicts Morocco's commitment to animal welfare and environmental sustainability. I urge you to reconsider this decision and instead focus on implementing humane solutions.

I respectfully request that:

- The planned culling of stray dogs be cancelled immediately.

- Animal welfare measures be adopted. 

- Public awareness campaigns be launched to educate citizens about the importance of animal welfare and to find loving homes for stray dogs.

- More animal shelters should be established at the country side
