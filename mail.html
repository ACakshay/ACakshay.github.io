<a href="mailto:jiocinema@jio.com,sengupta.arush@gmail.com?subject=Request to Modify or Remove Content in 'Magic of Shiri' Series - Concerns of Religious Sentiment&body=Dear Jio Cinema Team,%0D%0A

We hope this email finds you well. We are writing to express pure concerns regarding the portrayal of a character randomly becoming a Jain monk in the upcoming series 'Magic of Shiri.' While We appreciate the creativity and entertainment value of your productions, we would like to bring to your attention that the depiction of someone randomly becoming a Jain sadhu/monk goes against the actual process and traditions followed by the Jain community. This portrayal has the potential to hurt the religious sentiments of Jain followers.%0D%0A%0D%0A

Jainism, as a religious faith, holds significant reverence for the path of renunciation and spiritual discipline undertaken by Jain sadhus and monks. The process of becoming a Jain sadhu/monk is a deeply meaningful and sacred journey, involving years of preparation, self-discipline, and adherence to specific principles and rituals. The portrayal of this process as random or casual in your series may inadvertently mislead viewers and create a misunderstanding about Jainism.%0D%0A%0D%0A

In light of the above, We kindly request you to consider modifying the storyline of 'Magic of Shiri' to ensure accuracy and respect towards the religious sentiments of the Jain community. Alternatively, if modification is not possible, We would sincerely request you to remove the part that depicts the character randomly becoming a Jain monk. This step would help prevent any unintended misrepresentation or hurtful impact on the religious beliefs of Jain followers.%0D%0A%0D%0A

We understand that creative freedom is essential in the entertainment industry, and We acknowledge your team's efforts to entertain and engage audiences. By addressing this concern, you would not only demonstrate respect for religious diversity but also contribute to fostering understanding and harmony among viewers from different backgrounds%0D%0A%0D%0A

Thank you for taking the time to consider our request. We hope we can work together to ensure that 'Magic of Shiri' continues to be an enjoyable series while upholding the values of cultural sensitivity and accuracy.%0D%0A%0D%0A

We look forward to hearing from you and discussing this matter further. Please feel free to reach out to us at your convenience.%0D%0A">mail</a>
